m/0814255,Louise Keller,FALSE,Urban Cinefile,Fresh,,2010/2/6,"Uma Thurman as Medusa, the gorgon with a coiffure of writhing snakes and stone-inducing hypnotic gaze is one of the highlights of this bewitching fantasy"
m/0814255,,FALSE,FILMINK (Australia),Fresh,,2010/2/9,"With a top-notch cast and dazzling special effects, this will tide the teens over until the next Harry Potter instalment."
m/0814255,Ben McEachen,FALSE,Sunday Mail (Australia),Fresh,3.5/5,2010/2/9,"Whether audiences will get behind The Lightning Thief is hard to predict. Overall, it's an entertaining introduction to a promising new world -- but will the consuming shadow of Potter be too big to break free of?"

m/0814255,Bill Goodykoontz,TRUE,Arizona Republic,Fresh,3.5/5,2010/2/10,"Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references."
m/0814255,Jordan Hoffman,FALSE,UGO,Fresh,B,2010/2/10,"Fun, brisk and imaginative"
m/0814255,Jim Schembri,TRUE,The Age (Australia),Fresh,3月5日,2010/2/10,"Crammed with dragons, set-destroying fights and things exploding, [Columbus] squeezes in a few well-meaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display."
